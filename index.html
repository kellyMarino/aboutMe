    <h3>A funny story</h3>
    <p>One day, Kelly, a 23-year-old Colombian living in Belgium, decided to introduce her Belgian friends to the wonders of salsa dancing. 
        She invited them over for a mini dance party, determined to teach them the moves.
        <br>
        As the music started, Kelly demonstrated the steps with flair, her hips moving perfectly to the rhythm. Her friends tried to 
        follow along, but their movements were stiff and awkward. Laughing, Kelly encouraged them to loosen up and feel the music.
        <br>
        Mid-dance, Kelly’s phone buzzed with a video call from her mom in Colombia. She answered excitedly, showing her mom the dance 
        party. Her mom, ever the lively spirit, started giving dance tips through the screen, shouting, "¡Más salsa, menos robot!"
        <br>
        Kelly translated for her friends, who burst into laughter and tried even harder to shake off their robotic moves. 
        By the end of the night, they weren’t perfect dancers, but they definitely had the spirit – and a hilarious story 
        to remember their first salsa lesson!/p>
    <h5>TL;DR</h4>
     <p>Hey chatGPT: tell me a funny very short story about my life: my name is Kelly, I life in Belgium and I'm from Colombia.</p>
